How To Add IRCd Support
-----------------------

1) Files to Edit
2) Modifing the Header File
3) The Code
4) Modes
5) Functions / Events
6) CAPAB/PROTOCTL 

1) Files to Edit

    When preparing to add support to Anope for your ircd, you need to edit
    the following files. 

    A) Make a copy of the .c and .h file of the IRCd that matches the ircd
       that you are attempting to add support for best.

    First step in this process is to rename the .c and .h file after the IRCd
    that you are going to be adding support for. Its recommended that you come
    up with a name that is clear and easy to understand.

    You are now ready to start getting into the code.

2) Modifying the Header File

    Now that you have gotten past the first part of the creation process, you
    are into the code. This part is the harder and more complex part. You
    will need a general understanding of C code to continue. Here are the
    step by step instructions required to make this work.

    Open the .h file and find the section of code with

    #define UMODE_a 0x00000001
    #define UMODE_b 0x00000002

    This is where you define the MODES. All user modes are stored
    with UMODE_ followed by a letter matching the modes case; be careful to
    use the correct case as this will make it clear when you setup MODES in
    the .c in a few. Use hex values for the modes so starting at 0x00000001
    to 0x8000000. In most cases you want to list all modes. If you run out of
    values look at removing any modes that do not impact services.

    Channel modes are done much like user modes, with the exception that
    bans, exceptions, invites, and modes that are applied to a user such as
    op and voice are not defined here. All other modes are defined in here.
    Again be clear and use the correct case and use hex values as done with
    user modes.

    Finally we come to DEFAULT_MLOCK; this is the mode that services will set
    by default on channels when they are registered. In general you want this
    to be what is acceptable by the ircd; in most cases this is "+ntr". This is
    expressed by:

    #define DEFAULT_MLOCK CMODE_n | CMODE_t | CMODE_r

3) The Code

    Here is where the code of the .c file comes in. Be prepared to spend at
    least an hour, if not longer, going over the code and getting it right;
    Especially if you are setting up an ircd that is completely different
    than the one you used as a base. This section covers the majority of the
    code that is in use. 

    The first bit of code you will face is:

        IRCDVar ircd[] = { }

    This struct contains your basic IRCd functions. Your base source file has
    the list of all available variables; note that you should not swap any
    around, or you will break stuff. Here is a brief description of the usage
    of each.

    1) Name: This member tells Anope about the IRCD's name. It may contain
             text about its name and version. This is used to identify the
             build on startup.

    2) NickServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on NickServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    3) ChanServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on ChanServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    4) MemoServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on MemoServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    5) HostServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on HostServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. Note that if your ircd does not
                      support HostServ, you can safely make this NULL or +,
                      as there is a check before bringing HostServ online.

    6) OperServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on OperServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    7) BotServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on BotServ.
                     Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,

    8) HelpServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on HelpServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,

    10) Global Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on Global.
                     Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                     or a services flag. 

    11) NickServ Alias Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on the alias
                             of NickServ. Normally you want this to be some
                             form of oper flag, or a services flag.

                             form of oper flag, or a services flag. Note that
                             if your ircd does not support HostServ, you can
                             safely make this NULL or +, as there is a check
                             before bringing HostServ online.

    89) Reports sync: Does the IRCd report when it's in sync (or done bursting,
                      depending on how you want to say it)? Remember to set

                      When set to 1, anope will only parse strict CIDR masks.
                      IRCd's that try to correct invalid CIDR's (like nefarious)
                      will need a custom implementation in the core.
                      Contact the anope Dev Team if this is the case.
                      Set to 0 if CIDR's are not supported by your IRCd.

    91) Throttle Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for throttling joins per-user. 
                       Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    93) Delayed client introduction: Delay the introduction of services pseudo-
                                     client till after we have received the uplinks
                                     CAPAB.

    So we've had this long list. Now there's a second struct to fill. This
    struct isn't as long as the previous one though, so we'll handle it quite
    quick compared to the previous one.

        IRCDCAPAB ircdcap[] = { }

    This struct is based on the CAPAB defines. You should review the CAPAB
    table below to see how this should be done.

        Define Table

4) Modes 

    The next thing you should do is defining the user modes. You will want to
    have your .h file handy for this part.

        unsigned long umodes[128] = { }

    This array goes from 0 to 127 in the ASCII character set. Insert the user
    modes at the slot where the mode fits. If you are adding a the user mode
    of +i find the 105th (ASCII code of 'i') character slot in the array, and
    place the UMODE_i into this slot. Your base .c file should contain a good
    start for this, as well as a little help locating the characters.

	The following mode set is for the channel symbols. During a SJOIN event 
    the modes are sent usually before the nick. These normally are @, +, %
    etc.. depending on the ircd. Starting at ASCII 0 and running to 127. 
    Replace the 0 with the character (o = @, h = %) for the given mode. In the
    case of halfop which is usually sent as % replace the 37th character with
    'h', do this until all modes that are possible be received in this manor 
    have been inserted into the array.

	Now that you have that complete, the following array is ready to be dealt
    with. This is the cmmodes array, like the others it is a ASCII array
	starting at 0 and going to 127. However at the given letter you will want
    to enter the add, and delete function for the given mode. In the case of
    bans (+b) there is add_ban, and del_ban. Anope provides functions for 
    bans, exceptions and invites, should your ircd have more then these please
    contact Anope to discuss what can be done to add this mode.

5) Functions and Events

    A brief word about functions and events. All events are captured using:

        void moduleAddIRCDMsgs(void)
        {
            m = createMessage("NICK", anope_event_nick); 
            addCoreMessage(IRCD, m);
        }

    Each event should have a event handler if its important enough to be
    processed by services. All event functions should be formed like this:

        int anope_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)
        {
            return MOD_CONT;
        }

    They will receive the source; this can be NULL at times depending on the
    event. Next, ac is the number of arguments that are in the event, and av
    holds the values for each; so av[0] is the first variable, av[1] will be
    the second one, and so on. Events are likely to pass to various upper
    level event handlers; see the previous ircd source for how they handle
    these events.

    All commands are formed like this:

        void anope_cmd_svsnoop(char *server, int set)
        {
            send_cmd(NULL, "SVSNOOP %s %s", server, (set ? "+" : "-"));
        }

    They may take any number of arguments, depending on the command. They
    should eventually come to a send_cmd(); this root function is how
    commands are sent to the IRCd.

6) CAPAB/PROTOCTL

    Most IRCD send a CAPAB or PROTOCTL line so that they can work out what
    the other end of the connection is capable of doing. Anope has a function
    to read these lines and set itself up to to handle these events better.
    When adding support for your ircd, take the following steps.

    1) In the ircd.h file make sure to place the defines (see below) that
       match your IRCd's tokens; only use the ones that matter to your ircd.
       Should your IRCd add new features not covered in the defined, please
       contact the Anope Dev team before doing so. See README for information
       on how to contact the Anope team.

    2) Ensure that the CAPAB/PROTOCTL event his handled correctly. 

        A) In the function "moduleAddIRCDMsgs" making sure that you have the
           following two lines:
   
            m = createMessage("CAPAB", anope_event_capab); 
            addCoreMessage(IRCD, m);

        B) Add the function to handle the event

            int anope_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)
            {
                capab_parse(ac, av);
                return MOD_CONT;
            }

           This function should call the capab_parse function which parses
           the received CAPAB/PROTOCTL line.
